#### nginx_sblock.sh

thanks to [@Hiljaa](https://twitter.com/hiljaa) : [Clubmate.fi](http://clubmate.fi/how-to-make-an-nginx-server-block-manually-or-with-a-shell-script/), this linux shell script creates new NIGNX server blocks as well as new site folders in ```/var/www/```. I changed ```nginx restart``` to ```nginx reload``` to prevent interruption of existing sessions.
